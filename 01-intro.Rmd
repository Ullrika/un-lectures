# Introduction to Uncertainty Analysis {#intro}

## What is uncertainty and why is it important? 

- Type of uncertainty: Epistemic,  aleatory and other types
- Parameter/variable link to epistemic and aleatory uncertainty
- Exercise - toss a coin, throw a dice - show communication of direct uncertainty
- Exercise - example of a decision problem where one has different strengths in background knowledge -> need to also communicate indirect 

## Communication of uncertainty 

- Examples of graphs and tables and verbal expressions and quantitative measures (probability, probability distribution, uncertainty interval,..., confidence)

## Uncertainty analysis

- “A method to provide input to communicate uncertainty”
- Different measures and methods 
- Why probability is a good way to describe epistemic uncertainty
- Standards/guidelines
