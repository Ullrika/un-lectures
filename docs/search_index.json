["index.html", "Lectures on Uncertainty Lectures on Uncertainty", " Lectures on Uncertainty Ullrika Sahlin, Ivette Raices-Cruz, Dmytro Perepolkin 2019-12-18 Lectures on Uncertainty This intro is to be removed This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 0.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 0.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 0.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 10), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 0.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2019) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],

Compare with e.g. ML. Conjugate or MCMC sampling (find some Bayesian package that works fine or JAGs) Exercise - daily intact equation with data or expert judgement available. Possible dependence between intake and bodyweight. Conjugate or MCMC sampling. Optional Exercise - Quantifying uncertainty in a Population Viability Analysis They have some data, they have a population model, they have different management alternatives and scenarios "],
