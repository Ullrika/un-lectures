# Intervals and probability bounds {#interv}

Requires 1 and 2

## Interval as a measure of uncertainty

- Types of uncertainty intervals: Interval, probability interval, confidence interval
- Interval to separate epistemic from aleatory (frequency for aleatory, interval for epistemic)
- Interval to consider weakness in knowledge as first and second order measure of uncertainty (interval probability, imprecise probability)

## Interval analysis 

- Interval arithmetic
- Exercise - daily intake dose equation

## Probability bound analysis

- Calculus with bounded probability 
- Introduction to a probability box
- Calculus with pboxes
- Exercise - daily intake dose equation

## Probability vs interval or probability bounds analysis

Discussion about the pros/cons, limits/possibilities 

Exercise (Optional) â€“ compare to the probabilistic uncertainty analysis in 2
